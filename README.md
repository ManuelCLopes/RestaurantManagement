# RestaurantManagement
I implemented a restaurant management application as well as the respective database using Python. In front-end I used Tkinter python module and PostgreSQL11 as database server.
This application offer the administrator various benefits:
  - Register invoices and orders;
  - Create dishes and add them to the menu;
  - Control the product stock, as the products are sold;
  - Show sells statistics, as weekly revenue, daily revenue, weekly average revenue...;
  - Manage employee accounts;
  - Manage client profiles;
  - Save a menu history;
  - Save important data in XML file
